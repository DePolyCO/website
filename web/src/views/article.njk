        Is recycling as good as it seems? 
        If you think recycling is a sensible and useful solution for the 
        planet, you might need to consider how costly and demanding the system
        is, and how few recyclable plastics there are. I would like to point out
        that only the 9% of the plastics produced so far can be recycled. 
        It is not possible to equate plastic waste with waste such as glass, 
        metal and paper.

                I would like to point out that only the 9% of the plastics produced so far can be recycled. It is not possible to equate plastic waste with waste such as glass, metal and paper. While recycling or reusing non-plastic materials is easier and the rate is higher for non-plastic materials, recycling plastics is nothing but an empty promise.

                First, these plastics, whose production has increased rapidly in the last 20–30 years and doubled in the last 10 years, are low-cost materials that have more than one type identified by numbers. The best known are those up to number 7. Only the number 1 PETE bottles which are known as water, cola and mouthwash bottles; number 2 HDPE bottles namely detergent and milk bottles; 5 PP, namely honey, yoghurt pots and Tupperware are recyclable and active in the market. However, the rest are either not recyclable or not preferred because they are not profitable.

                There are two solutions to these plastics that cannot be recycled and are now everywhere in our lives. The first is to just say no, the second is to use Zero Waste products. In order to not be a part of this pile of trash, you can avoid single-use plastics.
